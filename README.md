# My WeeWX Dashboard Services

Just a few MQTT based services used to support my dashboard.

These services have been put together to aid in developing my personal MQTT based weather dashboard. Feel free you look and use within the terms of the GPL v3 license.

I make no guarantees these files will doing anything useful for you or anyone else, they may not even do anything at all. I also make no guarantee to support them, either now or into the future. By all means ask a question but I can't even guarantee an answer.
